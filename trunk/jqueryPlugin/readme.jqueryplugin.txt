How to use jQuery plugin

The usage of ie6no jQuery plugin is the same as of Standalone version. Note, that ie6no jQuery plugin doesn't support 
IE version less than 6.

So, the difference is only that instead of ie6no you should use $.ie6no. For example:
<script type="text/javascript">$.ie6no({runonload:true});</script>


Required jQuery 1.2.2 and later.
